## Aspire Tutorial - The Basics

This tutorial was written for students in the College of Art and Design for use with the Velocity CNC/Forest Scientific 3 axis CNC router that is housed in the Fabrication Lab. There are many programs on the market that can be used to generate G code for milling operations. The purpose of a G code generator is to help the user write code that tells the CNC mill each movement necessary to cut their drawing out of a solid block of material. CNC machines understand a language called G code. Before the advent of programs like Aspire, V-Carve or RhinoCAM, G code was all written by hand. In its simplest form, G code is a set of commands the tell the machine information such as spindle speed, go-to commands for the cutter and tool path specifics like step over and step down distances.

One of the main advantages of using Aspire or V-Carve to generate G code is that you can simply import a variety of 2D file types and easily create g-code for milling functions such as profiling and pocketing. You can import the following types of 2D and 3D files into Aspire:
